# About this project

This project was made with Nextjs 13 and Next-Auth with the intention of testing its functionalities with the src/app folders and the implementation of server and client components.

## Main libraries used in the project

- Nextjs v13: [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
- Next-auth v4 [Next-Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- Tailwindcss [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
